# EmberBane-Axe-Item-Guide-For-Oaklands.
This text document lists all items required for the emberbane axe along with the full prices of every item. This repositories main purpose is to STOP people from buying the expert pack on Oaklands as it is a HUGE waste of money.


Why The Expert Pack Is F**king A*s...

You can obtain all items in the Expert Pack in about 2 hours of grinding, maybe even less if you have help.

If possible, before you start this side quest, buy the Pro Pack in the Starter Pack tab in the in-game shop in Oaklands. 

It's 249 Robux and gives you 2 of the 3 items you need to get the Auderite Key and it'll make your journey so much easier in the end.

Before you start this, please go into a private and/or solo server. You can do so with the Singleplayer button at the top of the main menu screen in Oaklands as shown in the attached screenshot.

Below are the required items to obtain the Emberbane Axe With the price of each item shown.

Emberbane Axe - $50,000 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Required Items to Obtain - Auderite Key, Burning Skull, Meteor Core
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Auderite Key Item List - $50,000
--------------------------------------------------
$3,000 - Small Bombs

$21,000 - Reinforced Pickaxe

$21,000 - Reinforced Axe

$5,000 - Reinforced Chisel
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Burning Skull - $3,000
--------------------------------------------------
3 Small Bombs - $3,000
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Meteor Core - Time
--------------------------------------------------
Only found at the center of Meteor Crash Sites which only appear about every hour.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the end, the full cost of everything is $58,000 And a LOT of patience, Especially when you're waiting for a meteor to spawn in.

The Emberbane alone is Definitely the most time consuming item in the pack to get.

The Reinforced Pickaxe Can easily be obtained through roughly 30 minutes of farming Rosa Gold Ore in Mike's Mines with a cost of $44,000 In Game money.
 
So next time you think "Hmm, I wonder if I should buy the Expert Pack in Oaklands." Read this and remember why you shouldn't.

And if you only want the Grabbiest item from the pack, then just buy Pro Pack. It'll give you what you want.
