Why The Expert Pack Is F**king A*s...

You can obtain all items in the Expert Pack in about 2 hours of grinding, maybe even less if you have help.

If possible, before you start this side quest, buy the Pro Pack in the Starter Pack tab in the in-game shop in Oaklands. 

It's 249 Robux and gives you 2 of the 3 items you need to get the Auderite Key and it'll make your journey so much easier in the end.

Before you start this, please go into a private and/or solo server. You can do so with the Singleplayer button at the top of the main menu screen in Oaklands as shown in the attached screenshot.

Below are the required items to obtain the Emberbane Axe With the price of each item shown.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Emberbane Axe - $50,000 
----------------------------------------------------------------------

# Required Items to Obtain - Auderite Key, Burning Skull, Meteor Core

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Auderite Key Item List - $50,000
--------------------------------------------------
$3,000 - Small Bombs

$21,000 - Reinforced Pickaxe

$21,000 - Reinforced Axe

$5,000 - Reinforced Chisel

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Burning Skull - $3,000
--------------------------------------------------
3 Small Bombs - $3,000

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Meteor Core - Time
--------------------------------------------------
Only found at the center of Meteor Crash Sites which only appear about every hour.

You can find out when the next meteor will spawn with the use of the Jr. Scientist near the desert. Though optional, using the Jr. Scientist can help a lot but costs $3,500.

I will also showcase where and how to use the Jr. Scirentist in my video.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the end, the full cost of everything is $58,000 And a LOT of patience, Especially when you're waiting for a meteor to spawn in.

The Emberbane alone is Definitely the most time consuming item in the pack to get.

The Reinforced Pickaxe Can easily be obtained through roughly 30 minutes of farming Rosa Gold Ore in Mike's Mines with a cost of $44,000 In Game money.
 
So next time you think "Hmm, I wonder if I should buy the Expert Pack in Oaklands." Read this and remember why you shouldn't.

And if you only want the Grabbiest item from the pack, then just buy Pro Pack. It'll give you what you want.

But if you followed this guide correctly, then you should have everything in the Expert Pack for WAYYYYY cheaper.

I will soon update this repository to have a video tutorial of how to obtain all items and get the Emberbane Axe as well as the Rosa Gold Ore farming spot in Mike's Mines.
